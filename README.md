# MyReads Project

MyReads is a React project for Udacity's React Fundamental course. It is a web app that allows users to arrange their reading lists in different bookshelves. Users can also search new books and add books to their bookshelves.The search bar uses the Udacity's search API specific to this project. The search is limited to a particular set of search terms.
You can find these search terms here:
https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/blob/master/SEARCH_TERMS.md

Moving a book to shelf 'none' will delete the book from the bookshelves.
